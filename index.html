    <h2>About Me.</h2>
    
    <p>I study at INTC college in Almaty city. I am purposeful, I know how to work in a team, I worked in the creation of
    projects: to create a company scheme and protect it from the side of information security, and also worked with the
    "periodic table of security" during the creation of the project. I want to learn JS to expand my own knowledge and be
    able to switch to a developer.</p>

    <h2>My skills</h2>
    
    <p> I continue to take a course on HTML, CSS in GetCourse from "Glo Academy", I also studied on my own at
    [learn.javascript.ru] (https://learn.javascript.ru/). I still continue my studies at an IT college for a specialty
    "Information Security Technician". The level of English knowledge leaves much to be desired, I study Czech with the aim
    of moving and getting a higher education there.</p>

    <h2>Code examples</h2>
    
    <p>I didn't have examples of my code so I completed the suggested task in CodeWars. I had to find a bug in the code</p>

    javascript
    function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
    }
