# CV: Dautov Bekezhan

My work number: 87012131918, you can contact via Telegram, as well as my Discord "A4U4UK#2507".

## About Me.

I study at INTC college in Almaty city. I am purposeful, I know how to work in a team, I worked in the creation of
projects: to create a company scheme and protect it from the side of information security, and also worked with the
"periodic table of security" during the creation of the project. I want to learn JS to expand my own knowledge and be
able to switch to a developer.

### My skills

I continue to take a course on HTML, CSS in GetCourse from "Glo Academy", I also studied on my own at
[learn.javascript.ru] (https://learn.javascript.ru/). I still continue my studies at an IT college for a specialty
"Information Security Technician". The level of English knowledge leaves much to be desired, I study Czech with the aim
of moving and getting a higher education there.

#### Code examples

 I didn't have examples of my code so I completed the suggested task in CodeWars. I had to find a bug in the code

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
return a * b;
}
```
